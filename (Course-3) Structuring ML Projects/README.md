### Course 3
# Structuring Machine Learning Projects

## Course Certificate: [Verified by Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/W2HL68SLSD68)

**This course contains no assignments. But has two very interesting case-study quizzes posing real-life situations where the student has to make important practical decisions on the basis of the concepts taught in the first three courses of the specialization, and these decisions would affect the whole ML project, and would affect its performance.**

## Case-Study Quizzes
1. [Bird Recognition in the City of Peacetopia](https://github.com/sadanand1120/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/master/(Course-3)%20Structuring%20ML%20Projects/Bird%20Recognition%20in%20the%20city%20of%20Peacetopia%20(Case%20Study%20Quiz).pdf): It poses a situation in which the inhabitants of a city are very afraid of birds and want to get alerted whenever the security cameras detect any bird flying over their city. So the quiz poses many difficult but informative situations where the student has to decide the further course of action.

2. [Autonomous Driving](https://github.com/sadanand1120/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/master/(Course-3)%20Structuring%20ML%20Projects/Autonomous%20Driving%20(Case%20Study%20Quiz).pdf): It poses a scenario in which a start-up company is building autonomous self-driving cars, for which a system is required to detect road signs and traffic lights. Again, many different questions are asked in this quiz to apply the concepts learnt to "simulated" real-life problems.
